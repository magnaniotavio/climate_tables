This is a React application that uses the Wikipedia API to allow the user to search for the names of cities, including multiple names at once, and receive as a result the climate (temperature) tables that are contained in  that city's Wikipedia article.
If the article does not exist, or does not contain a climate table, the user receives an error message for that city.
In order to search for more than one city, just separate their names by a comma, like so: 'Rome, Liverpool, Rio de Janeiro'.
